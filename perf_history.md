# silicritter perf history

Durable record of performance measurements from experiment scripts.
Append one entry per significant run: what was measured, on what hardware,
with what code, and the actual numbers. Pass/fail alone is not enough;
this log is where drift is spotted.

Entries are chronological (oldest first) and immutable once recorded.
Use these numbers to spot regressions against previous runs, not just
against pass/fail thresholds.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 2: LIF forward-sim throughput baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step02_throughput.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/lif.py` (leaky integrate-and-fire, `jax.lax.scan` temporal loop, recurrent connectivity via N×N matmul on previous-step spikes)
- **Machine:** Huawei MateBook X Pro 2018 (MACH-WX9) — Intel i7-8550U + NVIDIA GeForce MX150 (2 GB VRAM, ~1.1 TFLOPS FP32), 16 GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04, NVIDIA driver 580 / CUDA 13.0
- **Stack:** Python 3.12.3, JAX 0.10.0 (CUDA 12 plugin), numpy 2.4.4
- **Parameters:** N = 1024 neurons, T = 10 000 steps (dt = 1 ms → 10 s simulated), 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                  | min       | median    |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms) | 1226.0    | 1226.1    |
| throughput (n·steps/s)  | 8.353e+06 | 8.352e+06 |

Mean firing rate across population: **40.0 Hz** (cortical-regime activity).

**Notes:**

- Repeat variance is negligible (min and median within 0.01 %), so thermal / boost effects aren't confounding at this scale.
- MX150 throughput is kernel-launch-overhead-limited for workloads this small, not sustained-compute-limited. Back-of-envelope: the dominant per-step cost is the N × N recurrent matmul (~2 N² ≈ 2.1 M FLOPS per step, ~21 GFLOPS total over 10 k steps). MX150 peak is ~1.1 TFLOPS, so a compute-bound floor is ~19 ms; we're ~65× off peak, dominated by per-step dispatch cost through `jax.lax.scan`.
- A modern discrete GPU (RTX 30-series or better) should see 10–100× better sustained throughput on the same script; this baseline is "GPU path is exercised correctly and JIT caches are hit," not "peak hardware performance."
- No plasticity in this baseline — weights are fixed. Slot-pool / structural-plasticity experiments will establish separate baselines as they land.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 3: slot-pool forward-sim baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step03_slotpool_throughput.py`
- **Modules under test:** `src/silicritter/slotpool.py` (SlotPool representation, `synaptic_current`, `step`, `simulate`) + `src/silicritter/lif.py` (`integrate_and_spike` helper, shared with the dense-weights path)
- **Machine:** same as step 2 (Huawei MateBook X Pro 2018, MX150)
- **Stack:** same as step 2 (Python 3.12.3, JAX 0.10.0)
- **Parameters:** N = 1024 neurons, K = 64 slots / post-neuron (≈6 % of dense connectivity), T = 10 000 steps, 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                             | min       | median    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms)            | 241.3     | 245.8     |
| throughput (neuron-steps/s)        | 4.24e+07  | 4.17e+07  |
| slot-eval throughput (slot-evals/s)| —         | 2.67e+09  |

Mean firing rate across population: **40.0 Hz** (matches step 2 regime).

**Notes:**

- **~5× speed-up over step 2 dense baseline** (8.35e6 → 4.24e7 neuron-steps/s). Per-step synaptic input dropped from O(N²) = 1 048 576 ops to O(N·K) = 65 536 ops — a 16× reduction in inner-loop work. The realized 5× speed-up (not 16×) is consistent with per-step dispatch / scan overhead on the MX150 still contributing a fixed baseline cost that doesn't shrink with smaller inner kernels.
- 40 Hz firing rate is preserved — the slot-pool representation with matched weight scale reproduces the step 2 firing regime qualitatively.
- Tests (`tests/test_slotpool.py`) include byte-exact equivalence between `slotpool.step(pool, ...)` and `lif.step(effective_weights(pool), ...)`, plus a full-trace equivalence over 50 steps — so the representation is validated against the dense-matrix ground truth, not just numerically plausible.
- Still no plasticity — slots are static. Step 4 adds three-factor STDP + valence broadcast on top of this representation.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 4: slot-pool + three-factor STDP baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step04_plastic_throughput.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/plasticity.py` (STDP traces, per-slot weight update modulated by scalar valence and gated by plasticity_rate)
- **Machine:** same as prior steps (MX150)
- **Stack:** same as prior steps
- **Parameters:** N = 1024, K = 64, T = 10 000; constant valence = +1; STDP defaults (tau_pre = tau_post = 20 ms, a_plus = 0.01, a_minus = 0.012, v ∈ [0, 0.5]); 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                             | min       | median    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms)            | 573.0     | 579.2     |
| throughput (neuron-steps/s)        | 1.79e+07  | 1.77e+07  |
| slot-eval throughput (slot-evals/s)| —         | 1.13e+09  |

Mean firing rate: **40.8 Hz** (same regime as steps 2 and 3).

Weight drift over 10 s of simulated time:

| statistic   | initial | final  |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| v mean      | 0.0397  | 0.0927 |
| v min       | 0.0000  | 0.0000 |
| v max       | 0.2471  | 0.5000 |

Mean absolute change **|Δv| = 0.081**; max **|Δv| = 0.4998** (at least one slot rode the entire dynamic range up to the v_max ceiling and got clipped).

**Notes:**

- **Plasticity cost vs. step 3: ~2.2× slower** (4.17e7 → 1.85e7 neuron-steps/s) for the per-step overhead of trace decay + two gathers + STDP update + clip. Slot-eval throughput fell from 2.67e9 to 1.18e9 slot-evals/s, roughly matching.
- Weights are clearly moving (max reached the clip ceiling, mean doubled) — plasticity is active, not just nominally wired. Tests confirm valence = 0 and plasticity_rate = 0 both freeze weights exactly.
- Constant valence = +1 is the simplest possible three-factor setup; time-varying valence (rewarding specific network states) lands when we have an embodied target in step 5+.
- Still no structural plasticity — slots are bound for the lifetime of the sim. Slots at v_min = 0 are functionally silent but not released back to the free pool. Structural release / acquisition is the missing piece before we can genuinely claim exuberance-and-pruning dynamics.
