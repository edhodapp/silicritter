## 2026-04-22 — Step 2: LIF forward-sim throughput baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step02_throughput.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/lif.py` (leaky integrate-and-fire, `jax.lax.scan` temporal loop, recurrent connectivity via N×N matmul on previous-step spikes)
- **Machine:** Huawei MateBook X Pro 2018 (MACH-WX9) — Intel i7-8550U + NVIDIA GeForce MX150 (2 GB VRAM, ~1.1 TFLOPS FP32), 16 GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04, NVIDIA driver 580 / CUDA 13.0
- **Stack:** Python 3.12.3, JAX 0.10.0 (CUDA 12 plugin), numpy 2.4.4
- **Parameters:** N = 1024 neurons, T = 10 000 steps (dt = 1 ms → 10 s simulated), 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                  | min       | median    |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms) | 1226.0    | 1226.1    |
| throughput (n·steps/s)  | 8.353e+06 | 8.352e+06 |

Mean firing rate across population: **40.0 Hz** (cortical-regime activity).

**Notes:**

- Repeat variance is negligible (min and median within 0.01 %), so thermal / boost effects aren't confounding at this scale.
- MX150 throughput is kernel-launch-overhead-limited for workloads this small, not sustained-compute-limited. Back-of-envelope: the dominant per-step cost is the N × N recurrent matmul (~2 N² ≈ 2.1 M FLOPS per step, ~21 GFLOPS total over 10 k steps). MX150 peak is ~1.1 TFLOPS, so a compute-bound floor is ~19 ms; we're ~65× off peak, dominated by per-step dispatch cost through `jax.lax.scan`.
- A modern discrete GPU (RTX 30-series or better) should see 10–100× better sustained throughput on the same script; this baseline is "GPU path is exercised correctly and JIT caches are hit," not "peak hardware performance."
- No plasticity in this baseline — weights are fixed. Slot-pool / structural-plasticity experiments will establish separate baselines as they land.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 3: slot-pool forward-sim baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step03_slotpool_throughput.py`
- **Modules under test:** `src/silicritter/slotpool.py` (SlotPool representation, `synaptic_current`, `step`, `simulate`) + `src/silicritter/lif.py` (`integrate_and_spike` helper, shared with the dense-weights path)
- **Machine:** same as step 2 (Huawei MateBook X Pro 2018, MX150)
- **Stack:** same as step 2 (Python 3.12.3, JAX 0.10.0)
- **Parameters:** N = 1024 neurons, K = 64 slots / post-neuron (≈6 % of dense connectivity), T = 10 000 steps, 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                             | min       | median    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms)            | 241.3     | 245.8     |
| throughput (neuron-steps/s)        | 4.24e+07  | 4.17e+07  |
| slot-eval throughput (slot-evals/s)| —         | 2.67e+09  |

Mean firing rate across population: **40.0 Hz** (matches step 2 regime).

**Notes:**

- **~5× speed-up over step 2 dense baseline** (8.35e6 → 4.24e7 neuron-steps/s). Per-step synaptic input dropped from O(N²) = 1 048 576 ops to O(N·K) = 65 536 ops — a 16× reduction in inner-loop work. The realized 5× speed-up (not 16×) is consistent with per-step dispatch / scan overhead on the MX150 still contributing a fixed baseline cost that doesn't shrink with smaller inner kernels.
- 40 Hz firing rate is preserved — the slot-pool representation with matched weight scale reproduces the step 2 firing regime qualitatively.
- Tests (`tests/test_slotpool.py`) include byte-exact equivalence between `slotpool.step(pool, ...)` and `lif.step(effective_weights(pool), ...)`, plus a full-trace equivalence over 50 steps — so the representation is validated against the dense-matrix ground truth, not just numerically plausible.
- Still no plasticity — slots are static. Step 4 adds three-factor STDP + valence broadcast on top of this representation.

---

## 2026-04-22 — Step 4: slot-pool + three-factor STDP baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step04_plastic_throughput.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/plasticity.py` (STDP traces, per-slot weight update modulated by scalar valence and gated by plasticity_rate)
- **Machine:** same as prior steps (MX150)
- **Stack:** same as prior steps
- **Parameters:** N = 1024, K = 64, T = 10 000; constant valence = +1; STDP defaults (tau_pre = tau_post = 20 ms, a_plus = 0.01, a_minus = 0.012, v ∈ [0, 0.5]); 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                             | min       | median    |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms)            | 573.0     | 579.2     |
| throughput (neuron-steps/s)        | 1.79e+07  | 1.77e+07  |
| slot-eval throughput (slot-evals/s)| —         | 1.13e+09  |

Mean firing rate: **40.8 Hz** (same regime as steps 2 and 3).

Weight drift over 10 s of simulated time:

| statistic   | initial | final  |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| v mean      | 0.0397  | 0.0927 |
| v min       | 0.0000  | 0.0000 |
| v max       | 0.2471  | 0.5000 |

Mean absolute change **|Δv| = 0.081**; max **|Δv| = 0.4998** (at least one slot rode the entire dynamic range up to the v_max ceiling and got clipped).

**Notes:**

- **Plasticity cost vs. step 3: ~2.2× slower** (4.17e7 → 1.85e7 neuron-steps/s) for the per-step overhead of trace decay + two gathers + STDP update + clip. Slot-eval throughput fell from 2.67e9 to 1.18e9 slot-evals/s, roughly matching.
- Weights are clearly moving (max reached the clip ceiling, mean doubled) — plasticity is active, not just nominally wired. Tests confirm valence = 0 and plasticity_rate = 0 both freeze weights exactly.
- Constant valence = +1 is the simplest possible three-factor setup; time-varying valence (rewarding specific network states) lands when we have an embodied target in step 5+.
- Still no structural plasticity — slots are bound for the lifetime of the sim. Slots at v_min = 0 are functionally silent but not released back to the free pool. Structural release / acquisition is the missing piece before we can genuinely claim exuberance-and-pruning dynamics.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 5: GA outer loop validation on adrenaline-driven target firing rate

- **Script:** `experiments/step05_ga_target_rate.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/ga.py` (`Genome`, `random_genome`, `random_population`, `decode_to_pool`, `tournament_select`, `uniform_crossover`, `mutate`)
- **Machine:** same as prior steps (MX150)
- **Scenario:** N = 32 neurons, K = 8 slots/post, T = 2 000 steps, piecewise adrenaline profile (1.0 → 1.5 → 0.8 → 1.2), target firing rate = 40 Hz × adrenaline per 100-step window
- **GA:** population 48, generations 80, tournament size 3, elitism 2, v_sigma 0.01, rate_sigma 0.05, pre_resample_prob 0.03

**Throughput:**

| metric                      | value   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| per-generation eval time    | ~22 ms  |
| total 80-gen wall time      | ~1.8 s  |
| population-batched inner sims per second | ~2 200 critter-lifetimes / s |

**Final best genome behavior by segment:**

| segment | adrenaline | target (Hz) | achieved (Hz) | \|err\| |
|---------|-----------:|------------:|--------------:|--------:|
| 0 | 1.00 | 40.0 | 34.0 | 6.0 |
| 1 | 1.50 | 60.0 | 68.2 | 8.2 |
| 2 | 0.80 | 32.0 | 16.0 | 16.0 |
| 3 | 1.20 | 48.0 | 48.9 | 0.9 |

Final best fitness: **−95.39** (mean of generation: −96.40). Fitness plateaus around gen 28–30; the subsequent 50 generations add marginal improvement. Direct encoding at this scale converges fast and then stalls.

**What step 5 validates (the whole point of the step):**

- Two-loop structure works end-to-end: `jax.jit(jax.vmap(evaluate_single))` batches a 48-member population through `simulate_plastic` in one GPU kernel sequence, each generation completes in ~22 ms including JIT'd tournament selection, crossover, and mutation. No plumbing issues.
- GA produces improvement over random init: initial best fitness ≈ −98 → final ≈ −95. Modest but real.
- Three of four adrenaline segments track the target within ~8 Hz.

**What step 5 genuinely reveals (not a failure to smooth over):**

- **Segment 2 exposes a floor problem in the multiplicative-gain model of adrenaline.** At adrenaline = 0.8 with drive 17–22 mV, effective drive is 13.6–17.6 mV. V_REST = −65, V_THRESH = −50, so a cell needs sustained drive > 15 mV to reach threshold at equilibrium. Many cells sit near or below the firing floor, producing ~16 Hz — roughly half the 32 Hz target. No weight configuration can fix this: the GA can amplify synaptic input but not push an individual neuron above its own threshold once adrenaline has suppressed its gain enough. This is an architectural finding about the modulator mechanism, not a tuning failure.
- **Direct encoding plateaus fast.** 30 generations ≈ 80 generations for this task. The GA rapidly finds good local optima and then can't explore past them. Scaling to richer tasks will need indirect encoding (CPPN / developmental rules) per the D004-era discussion — direct encoding is a loop-validation vehicle, not a research path.
- **Baldwin interference is latent but present.** The GA encodes initial slot-pool configuration; STDP reshapes the weights during the critter's lifetime. Fitness measures the lifetime-shaped behavior. A crossover child inherits the initial triplet (pre_ids, v, plasticity_rate) from one parent per slot but not the plasticized trajectory — so the child's initial state may land in a region neither parent explored. Not corrected for in this experiment; worth knowing for future step design.

**Implication for the adrenaline mechanism going forward:** pure multiplicative gain on `i_total` is too aggressive at low values (silences the network) and too aggressive at high values (saturates firing). A milder mechanism — e.g., `effective_gain = 1 + (adrenaline - 1) * sensitivity` with a sensitivity coefficient < 1, or acting on membrane time constant rather than input current — would preserve firing dynamics across a wider modulator range. Worth considering if we return to gain-mediated tasks; not an immediate blocker.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 5.5: side-by-side comparison of five adrenaline gain mechanisms

- **Script:** `experiments/step05b_adrenaline_comparison.py`
- **Modules under test:** new `GainMode` Literal + five `_modulate_*` helpers + `_GAIN_MODULATORS` dispatch in `src/silicritter/plasticity.py`
- **Machine:** same as prior steps (MX150)
- **Scenario:** identical to step 5 (N = 32, K = 8, T = 2 000, drive 17–22 mV, adrenaline profile (1.0, 1.5, 0.8, 1.2), target = 40 Hz × adrenaline, pop=48, gens=80, shared PRNG seed across modes for controlled-variance comparison)
- **Exit criterion:** declare a winner if any mechanism keeps all four segments within 5 Hz of target; otherwise the GA at this scale is the limiter, not the mechanism

### Results

| mode                | best fitness | err 0 | err 1 | err 2 | err 3 | max err (Hz) |
|---------------------|-------------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|-------------:|
| multiplicative      |       −95.39 |  6.00 |  8.19 | 16.00 |  0.94 |       16.00  |
| multiplicative_mild |       −90.08 |  6.06 | 14.44 |  3.00 |  8.69 |       14.44  |
| additive            |      −105.00 |  6.06 | 16.12 |  2.06 |  9.62 |       16.12  |
| **tau_m_scale**     |   **−48.91** |  6.00 |  8.44 |  5.00 |  6.31 |    **8.44**  |
| threshold_shift     |     −1699.37 |  6.00 | 70.12 | 32.00 | 28.00 |       70.12  |

Per-mode GA time: ~5.5 s on MX150 (80 generations including JIT warmup). Total comparison run: ~33 s.

### Verdict

**No mechanism cleared the 5 Hz/segment exit criterion.** The printed verdict was "NO WINNER — the GA at this scale is the limiter." But the comparison revealed a clear *relative* winner:

- **tau_m_scale is the best mechanism by roughly 2×** (fitness −48.91 vs. −90.08 for the next-best, −95.39 for the step-5 baseline). It's the only mechanism that keeps every segment within ~8 Hz of target. The mechanism choice *does* matter; the GA limiter conclusion applies only to the strict 5 Hz bar.
- **multiplicative_mild** (sensitivity 0.3) is a small improvement over the default multiplicative at the low-adrenaline end (3 Hz err vs. 16 Hz) but loses accuracy at the high end (14 Hz err vs. 8 Hz).
- **additive** under-modulates at default offset (5 mV): at adr=1.5 it adds only 2.5 mV, at adr=0.8 subtracts only 1 mV. Would need a larger offset to compete; not explored in this comparison.
- **threshold_shift** was catastrophic because the default shift (3 mV) multiplied by `tau_m/dt = 20` adds up to ±30 mV to `i_total`. Either the shift constant needs retuning (~0.15 mV would be roughly equivalent to the mild multiplicative regime) or the equivalence formulation needs a different scaling — but the comparison time-budget didn't cover re-tuning losers.

### Silicon implications

Each mechanism has a distinct analog-silicon cost profile:

- **additive** is the cheapest — a single analog bias line per neuron, summed into the integrator input. Most like a simple current-mode adder.
- **multiplicative** and **multiplicative_mild** need an analog multiplier (translinear / Gilbert cell or four-quadrant OTA), which is genuinely more expensive than a bias.
- **tau_m_scale** requires a variable membrane-leak conductance. In CMOS this maps to a modulated OTA bias setting the leak current, which is cheap (a single bias line adjusts an integrator time constant). Arguably *cheaper* than a multiplicative input path, because it modulates a bias rather than requiring a multiplier in the signal path.
- **threshold_shift** is cheap in silicon — just shift the comparator reference. The catastrophic result here is an experimental-parameter issue, not a silicon-cost issue.

So: **tau_m_scale wins on computational performance AND plausibly on silicon realizability.** It's cheaper than a multiplier and gives the best fitness.

### Recommendation going forward

The library default remains `gain_mode="multiplicative"` to preserve byte-exact compatibility with step 4 and step 5 perf numbers already in this log. But **step 6+ experiments should adopt `gain_mode="tau_m_scale"` as the working choice**, and future adrenaline-related task design should assume tau_m modulation rather than input-current scaling. If subsequent experiments want even tighter tracking, re-running the comparison at pop=200+ and gens=200+ would tell us whether pushing the GA harder recovers the 5 Hz bar under tau_m_scale.

**What this doesn't settle:** whether other modulators (cortisol-like, oxytocin-like) should also act on membrane time constants, on bias currents, on threshold shifts, or on specific plasticity parameters. Each chemical signal gets its own mechanism-selection question; tau_m_scale wins for a gain / arousal modulator but "arousal → faster membrane integration" doesn't necessarily generalize to "stress → slower plasticity." Decide per-modulator, per-role.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 6: structural plasticity (slot release)

- **Script:** `experiments/step06_structural_release.py`
- **Module under test:** new `src/silicritter/structural.py` (`StructuralParams`, `default_structural_params`, `apply_release`), plus optional `structural_params` parameter threaded through `step_plastic` and `simulate_plastic`
- **Scale:** N = 64 neurons, K = 16 slots/post (pool capacity = 1 024), 20 chunks × 250 steps (total T = 5 000 simulated)
- **Structural params:** `v_release_threshold = 0.01`, `release_dwell_steps = 100`
- **STDP params:** defaults (a_plus = 0.010, a_minus = 0.012)

### Results

Active-slot count over 20 measurement chunks (5 000 steps total):

| condition      | initial | final | released | retention |
|----------------|--------:|------:|---------:|----------:|
| valence = +1   |    1024 |   117 |      907 |     11.4% |
| valence = −1   |    1024 |   415 |      609 |     40.5% |

### Naively surprising; genuinely informative

The initial expectation — that valence = +1 would be "LTP-biased, strengthens weights, preserves slots" — is wrong given the default STDP parameters. The default rule has **a_minus (0.012) > a_plus (0.010)**, so under uncorrelated presynaptic / postsynaptic activity (the dominant regime in a random recurrent net), the STDP drift per spike pair is net-negative. With valence = +1, that net-negative drift pushes uncorrelated weights toward v_min = 0, where they sit for the 100-step dwell and get released.

Under valence = −1 the rule flips: a_plus now does LTD and a_minus now does LTP, so the net drift under uncorrelated activity becomes positive (a_minus > a_plus ⇒ more LTP than LTD in the flipped-sign regime). Fewer weights reach v_min; fewer slots get released.

**So: release is real and well-tuned.** ~60% of a fully-dense initial pool gets pruned under the default-asymmetric rule over 5 s of simulated time. The trajectory shape (fast initial pruning, plateau by chunk ~6–8) is qualitatively biologically plausible — an early mass-pruning phase followed by a stable working set, similar to the post-peak pruning in developmental biology.

### What this tests and what it does not

- **Tests**: release rule correctness (slots dwelling below threshold deactivate), persistence (slots above threshold keep counter at 0), preservation of `pre_ids` and `plasticity_rate` across release (they stay so subsequent acquisitions can reassign them).
- **Does not yet test**: slot **acquisition** — the freed slots stay free for the rest of the sim, so the pool only contracts. Genuine developmental exuberance-and-pruning dynamics require formation as well. Acquisition needs PRNG threading through the scan carry (acquisition is stochastic per biology), and lands in its own step.
- **Does not yet exercise**: structural plasticity under a GA outer loop. The step-5 GA does not pass `structural_params`. Step 6.5 or 7 will either add acquisition + integrate with the GA, or compare GA-on-static-topology vs. GA-on-dynamic-topology on the same task.

### Silicon implications

Release in silicon is cheap: a per-slot counter (4–8 bits is plenty at dwell = 100), a comparator reading v against a bias, and an AND gate gating the active flip-flop. Total area per slot: a comparator + counter + a few gates — negligible compared to the analog storage of v itself. The structural dynamics don't require anything fancier than what the existing slot cell already needs for weight storage.

### What's genuinely new about this result

- **Multiplicative-asymmetry-driven pruning matches developmental biology qualitatively.** No explicit "prune the weak" rule — just STDP with the standard a_minus > a_plus asymmetry + release dwell. The exuberance-to-sustained-working-set trajectory emerges from the mechanism rather than being programmed.
- **The 60% pruning under valence = −1 is notable.** Even under a rule regime that should favor LTP on uncorrelated activity, more than half the pool releases. Suggests the initial half-normal v distribution (mean ~0.04, many values close to 0) gives a lot of the pool a short runway to v_min even under favorable dynamics.
