# silicritter perf history

Durable record of performance measurements from experiment scripts.
Append one entry per significant run: what was measured, on what hardware,
with what code, and the actual numbers. Pass/fail alone is not enough;
this log is where drift is spotted.

Entries are chronological (oldest first) and immutable once recorded.
Use these numbers to spot regressions against previous runs, not just
against pass/fail thresholds.

## 2026-04-22 — Step 2: LIF forward-sim throughput baseline

- **Script:** `experiments/step02_throughput.py`
- **Module under test:** `src/silicritter/lif.py` (leaky integrate-and-fire, `jax.lax.scan` temporal loop, recurrent connectivity via N×N matmul on previous-step spikes)
- **Machine:** Huawei MateBook X Pro 2018 (MACH-WX9) — Intel i7-8550U + NVIDIA GeForce MX150 (2 GB VRAM, ~1.1 TFLOPS FP32), 16 GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04, NVIDIA driver 580 / CUDA 13.0
- **Stack:** Python 3.12.3, JAX 0.10.0 (CUDA 12 plugin), numpy 2.4.4
- **Parameters:** N = 1024 neurons, T = 10 000 steps (dt = 1 ms → 10 s simulated), 5 timed repeats after a warmup pass

| metric                  | min       | median    |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| wall-clock elapsed (ms) | 1226.0    | 1226.1    |
| throughput (n·steps/s)  | 8.353e+06 | 8.352e+06 |

Mean firing rate across population: **40.0 Hz** (cortical-regime activity).

**Notes:**

- Repeat variance is negligible (min and median within 0.01 %), so thermal / boost effects aren't confounding at this scale.
- MX150 throughput is kernel-launch-overhead-limited for workloads this small, not sustained-compute-limited. Back-of-envelope: the dominant per-step cost is the N × N recurrent matmul (~2 N² ≈ 2.1 M FLOPS per step, ~21 GFLOPS total over 10 k steps). MX150 peak is ~1.1 TFLOPS, so a compute-bound floor is ~19 ms; we're ~65× off peak, dominated by per-step dispatch cost through `jax.lax.scan`.
- A modern discrete GPU (RTX 30-series or better) should see 10–100× better sustained throughput on the same script; this baseline is "GPU path is exercised correctly and JIT caches are hit," not "peak hardware performance."
- No plasticity in this baseline — weights are fixed. Slot-pool / structural-plasticity experiments will establish separate baselines as they land.
